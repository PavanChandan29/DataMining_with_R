**For Association Rules:**
Strong Association with "RFG BUTTER" Subcategory:
Rules 1-6 indicate a very strong (100% confidence) association between different forms (CHURNED, ROLL, WHIPPED) and the subcategory RFG BUTTER. This suggests that these forms are exclusively or almost exclusively associated with the RFG BUTTER subcategory.
Similarly, when combining CAG.Tier.Value with ROLL and WHIPPED forms (Rules 4-6), there's a perfect association with RFG BUTTER. This could imply that these specific combinations are uniquely characteristic of the RFG BUTTER subcategory.
Geography and CAG Tier Value Association with "MARGARINE/SPREADS":

Rules 7-9 show a 100% association between certain geographies and CAG.Tier.Value of VALUE with the MARGARINE/SPREADS subcategory. This suggests that in these specific geographic areas, products classified as VALUE are always associated with MARGARINE/SPREADS.
This insight can be particularly useful for targeted marketing and inventory management in these geographies.

These insights can inform various business strategies, including product placement, inventory stocking, and promotional campaigns. 
For instance, knowing that certain forms are exclusively associated with a specific subcategory can help in efficient stocking of products in various locations.
Additionally, understanding these associations can aid in tailoring marketing strategies for specific geographic locations, ensuring that the marketing efforts are resonating with the purchasing patterns and preferences of the local market.

**For Hierarchical CLustering**
Cluster Separation: The clusters appear to be well-separated in the scatter plots involving Total_Unit_Sale and Total_Volume_Sale, which indicates that these two variables are good predictors for differentiating between clusters.

Price and Sales Relationship: There seems to be a positive correlation between Total_Unit_Sale and Total_Volume_Sale. As the number of units sold increases, the total volume sold also increases, which is expected since these two are related measures of sales.

Cluster Characteristics:
The red cluster seems to represent items with low Price.per.Unit and Price.per.Volume, and also low Total_Unit_Sale and Total_Volume_Sale.
The green cluster might represent items with higher sales in both units and volume, as seen by the upward trend in scatter plots involving Total_Unit_Sale and Total_Volume_Sale.
The black cluster is not as clearly defined in terms of sales volume and unit sales but seems to be characterized by higher prices per unit and per volume.

Outliers: There are a few data points that stand out from the clusters, especially in the Price.per.Unit and Price.per.Volume scatter plots. 
These could be outliers or high-value items that are not part of the larger trends in the data.

Price Distribution: There is not a clear clustering pattern based on price alone, which suggests that price may not be the primary driver of the clustering. 
The clusters are more distinct when looking at the sales variables.
Based on these insights, we infer that the segmentation is primarily driven by sales volume and unit sales rather than price points. 
This suggests that customer purchasing patterns are more about the quantity of product moved rather than the price points of those products.


**Partitional Clustering**
There is a significant amount of variation in sales of all three product types across different geographic regions. 
Sticks and Tubs would be top forms for manufacturers and brands to target to expand their reach and grow their sales by targeting specific geographic markets.
California, Great Lakes, and Northeast are the regions where sticks and tubs have a decent number of sales. 
Brands that are struggling to sell their products in a particular region or form could use the insights from the clustering to identify the specific reasons for their low sales and develop strategies to address them.

35% of unit sales are predominantly in the northeast region and have almost equal contributions from the mainstream, premium, super-premium, and value products.
Brands looking to penetrate the table-spread market should focus on the northeast region for growth and profitability.
Northeast and midsouth are price-sensitive regions where value and mainstream table spreads have a good footprint.
For brands/manufacturers with unvarying table spreads and looking for moderate sales volume and moderate profitability, these two regions would be ideal.
