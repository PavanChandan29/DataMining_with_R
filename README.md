# DataMining_with_R
Data mining on sales data of table spreads

# Objectives for this data mining project are as follows:
_Understand Sales Dynamics:_ 
Analyze the sales data of table spreads across different geographies, subcategories, forms, and tiers to understand the dynamics influencing sales.   

_Identify Key Drivers of Sales:_ 
Determine the factors that most significantly impact sales, such as price, geographic location, product form, and tier value.   

_Segmentation and Targeting:_ 
Utilize clustering to identify distinct segments in the data. This will help in understanding the different consumer groups or market segments, which can be targeted with specific strategies.   

_Predictive Modeling:_ 
Develop logistic regression, and random forest models to predict sales. This will aid in understanding the relationship between different classes and sales, and in forecasting future sales.   

_Model Comparison and Selection:_ 
Compare different models based on their performance to select the best model for predicting sales.   

_Business Strategy Formulation:_
