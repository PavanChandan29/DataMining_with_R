Data mining on sales data of table spreads

# The primary objectives for this data mining project are as follows:
Understand Sales Dynamics: Analyze the sales data of table spreads across different geographies, subcategories, forms, and tiers to understand the dynamics influencing sales.
Identify Key Drivers of Sales: Determine the factors that most significantly impact sales, such as price, geographic location, product form, and tier value.
Segmentation and Targeting: Utilize clustering to identify distinct segments in the data. This will help in understanding the different consumer groups or market segments, which can be targeted with specific strategies.
Predictive Modeling: Develop logistic regression, and random forest models to predict sales. This will aid in understanding the relationship between different classes and sales, and in forecasting future sales.
Model Comparison and Selection: Compare different models based on their performance to select the best model for predicting sales.
Business Strategy Formulation: Based on the insights gained from the analysis, formulate strategies to enhance sales and market penetration.
